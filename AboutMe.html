      <h1>aboutMe</h1>
      <p>Hey guys! My name is Peter Jones. You can call me Pete. Sarah is my wife and we've been married for just over 2 years now. We have a 62 pound dog named Walter that is as mischievous as they come.  I love sports, movies, video games, am a hip hop artist, and have had the good fortune of traveling to quite a few places. I'm sure in our time together, we'll get to have a chat about all these things, what you're into, and what we're gonna build with this new found skill we all hope to acquire. Here's a song my buddy Raphael and I made back in 2014. Enjoy!
      </p>
